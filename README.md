# CS50x Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard University's online course, CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science (2025).

I am using this repository to organize my code, track my progress, and revisit concepts in computer science.

## Topics Covered (2025 Syllabus)

- **Week 0:** Scratch
- **Week 1:** C
- **Week 2:** Arrays

### How to Run
You might need to run these codes on in CS50 IDE as it involves <cs50.h> header file which other compilers don't recognize.
Most of these files can be compiled and run using a C compiler (like `clang`) or interpreted with Python.

Example for a C file:
```bash
clang -o problem problem.c
./problem
